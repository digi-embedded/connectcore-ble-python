ConnectCore Bluetooth Low Energy Python samples
===============================================

The ConnectCore Bluetooth Low Energy Python Library includes several samples to
demonstrate its functionality.

All of the sample applications are contained in the examples folder. Every
sample includes the source code and a **readme.txt** file to clarify the
purpose and the required setup to launch the application.

This is the list of available samples:

* :ref:`configureInterfaces`


.. _configureInterfaces:

Configure Interfaces sample
```````````````````````````

This sample Python application shows how to read and write a set of several
interface parameters in JSON format using BLE as the communication transport
in ConnectCore devices.

The application uses text files to store fake network interfaces parameters
that can be read and set from a mobile application using the ConnectCore
Bluetooth Low Energy service.

You can locate the example in the following path:
